I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Economics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor degree in economics and my double bachelor degree in mathematics from Sun Yat-Sen Univerisity. 

In Spring 2024, I am a visiting Ph.D. student at Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.  

I specialize in econometric theory, with a keen interest in high-dimensional data. My current research focuses on causal inference with instrumental variables, and machine learning for nonstationary time series. I also have research works on robust inference for panel data.
