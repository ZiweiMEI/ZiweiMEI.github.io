I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Department of Economics, the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Before joining CUHK, I obtained my bachelor degree in economics and my double bachelor degree in mathematics from Sun Yat-Sen Univerisity. 

I specialize in econometric theory. My current research focuses on the application of statistical learning methods in instrumental variable regression and time series models.
